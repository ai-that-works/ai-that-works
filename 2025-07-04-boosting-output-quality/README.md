## Key Takeaways

- Strategic automation of content pipelines requires balancing AI capabilities with manual processes
- Context engineering and data structure are more important than prompt engineering
- Short, deterministic tokens improve reliability compared to random UUIDs
- Model selection should be based on specific use cases - Gemini excels at summarization
- Breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps improves output quality
- Implementing "autonomy sliders" gives users control over AI automation levels

## Core Architecture

The content pipeline architecture focuses on three main components:

1. Data Collection & Processing
   - Integration with Zoom and Luma for meeting context
   - Custom serializers for relevant field selection
   - Structured data validation before LLM processing

2. Context Engineering Layer
   - Filtered data selection for LLM input
   - Deterministic token generation
   - Schema-driven data formatting

3. Output Generation & Validation
   - Model-specific prompt structuring
   - Automated testing for critical elements (links, facts)
   - Programmatic post-processing for consistency

The system implements multiple checkpoints for quality control and allows for manual intervention when needed through autonomy controls.

## Running the Code

The pipeline can be configured with different levels of automation:

1. Data Collection:
```python
# Configure data sources
config = {
    'zoom_integration': True,
    'luma_integration': True,
    'custom_fields': ['title', 'description', 'participants']
}
```

2. Context Engineering:
```python
# Define context parameters
context = {
    'token_type': 'deterministic',
    'required_fields': ['summary', 'key_points'],
    'validation_rules': {...}
}
```

3. Output Generation:
```python
# Set up generation pipeline
pipeline = ContentPipeline(
    model='gemini',
    autonomy_level=0.7,
    validation_enabled=True
)
```
