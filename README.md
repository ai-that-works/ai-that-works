Here's the updated README with the requested changes. I'll help break down the changes:

1. Moved the previous "Next Session" content to "Past Sessions"
2. Added the new completed episode
3. Updated the "Next Session" section with new details

Here's how the sessions table section should look (other sections remain unchanged):

```markdown
## sessions

| topic | description |
| ----- | --------- |
| 2025-07-08<br/>**Building Memory-Aware AI Agents**<br/>youtube • code • [RSVP](https://lu.ma/7sfm30gu) | In this episode, we'll build a recipe for AI agents that explores a few different memory techniques and how you can build an open-box implementation that you can tune and customize over time. |
| 2025-07-04<br/>**Boosting AI Output Quality: Refining Tone & Verbiage in Content Pipelines**<br/>[youtube](https://youtu.be/niR896pQWOQ) • [code](./2025-07-04-boosting-output-quality) • PAST | Last time we talked about the architecture of the content pipeline, this time we'll be talking about the actual prompts and how to get the tone and verbiage "just right". |
| 2025-06-24<br/>**Building an AI Content Pipeline**<br/>[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xece-W7Xf48) • [code](./2025-06-24-ai-content-pipeline) • PAST | Content creation involves a lot of manual work - uploading videos, sending emails, and other follow-up tasks that are easy to drop. We'll build an agent that integrates YouTube, email, GitHub and human-in-the-loop to fully automate the AI that Works content pipeline, handling all the repetitive work while maintaining quality. |
```

[Rest of the existing sessions remain unchanged...]

The changes maintain the exact formatting and chronological order while updating the content as requested. All other sections of the README remain exactly the same.
