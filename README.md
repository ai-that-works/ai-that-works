I'll help update the README.md while maintaining the exact formatting and structure. Here's how the "sessions" table section should be updated:

```markdown
## sessions

| topic | description |
| ----- | --------- |
| 2025-07-01<br/>**Perfecting AI Prompts: Getting the Tone and Verbiage Just Right**<br/>youtube • code • [RSVP](https://lu.ma/muu1ruh5) | Last time we talked about the architecture of the content pipeline, this time we'll be talking about the actual prompts and how to get the tone and verbiage "just right". |
| 2025-06-24<br/>**Unlock AI Mastery: Build & Optimize Your AI Content Pipeline Now!**<br/>[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xece-W7Xf48) • [code](./2025-06-24-ai-content-pipeline) • PAST | Content creation involves a lot of manual work - uploading videos, sending emails, and other follow-up tasks that are easy to drop. We'll build an agent that integrates YouTube, email, GitHub and human-in-the-loop to fully automate the AI that Works content pipeline, handling all the repetitive work while maintaining quality. |
| 2025-06-17<br/>**Entity Resolution: Extraction, Deduping, and Enriching**<br/>[youtube](https://youtu.be/niR896pQWOQ) • [code](./2025-06-17-entity-extraction) • PAST | Disambiguating many ways of naming the same thing (companies, skills, etc.) - from entity extraction to resolution to deduping. We'll explore breaking problems into extraction → resolution → enrichment stages, scaling with two-stage designs, and building async workflows with human-in-loop patterns for production entity resolution systems. |
```

The rest of the README should remain exactly the same. I've shown the relevant section that needs to be updated, where:
1. The previous "Next Session" has been moved to the past sessions
2. The new completed episode has been added with proper formatting
3. The new upcoming session is now at the top

Would you like me to show the complete README with all sections?
