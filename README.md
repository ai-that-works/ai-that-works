| 2025-08-26<br/>**#20: Claude for non-code tasks**<br/>[RSVP](https://lu.ma/2b5jzjyp) | ‚ÄãOn #17 we talked about advanced context engineering workflows for using Claude code to work in complex codebases. This week, we're gonna get a little weird with it, and show off a bunch of ways you can use Claude Code as a generic agent to handle non-coding tasks. We'll learn things like:<br/><br/>‚ÄãSkipping the MCP and having claude write its own scripts to interact with external systems<br/><br/>‚ÄãCreating internal knowledge graphs with markdown files<br/><br/>‚ÄãHow to blend agentic retrieval and search with deterministic context packing |
| 2025-08-19<br/>**#19: Interruptible Agents**<br/>[youtube](https://youtu.be/2ivXNdHJpxk) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-08-19-interruptible-agents) ‚Ä¢ PAST | Anyone can build a chatbot, but the user experience is what truly sets it apart. Can you cancel a message? Can you queue commands while it's busy? How finely can you steer the agent? We'll explore these questions and code a solution together. |
| 2025-08-12<br/>**#18: Decoding Context Engineering Lessons from Manus**<br/>[youtube](https://youtu.be/OaUOHEHtlOU) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-08-12-manus-context-engineering) ‚Ä¢ PAST | ‚ÄãA few weeks ago, the Manus team published an excellent paper on context engineering. It covered KV Cache, Hot-swapping tools with custom samplers, and a ton of other cool techniques.<br/><br/>‚ÄãOn this week's episode, we'll dive deep on the manus Article and put some of the advice into practice, exploring how a deep understanding of models and inference can help you to get the most out of today's LLMs. |
| 2025-08-05<br/>**#17: Context Engineering for Coding Agents**<br/>[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42AzKZRNhsk) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-08-05-advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents) ‚Ä¢ PAST | By popular demand, AI That Works #17 will dive deep on a new kind of context engineering: managing research, specs, and planning to get the most of coding agents and coding CLIs. You've heard people bragging about spending thousands/mo on Claude Code, maxing out Amp limits, and much more. Now Dex and Vaibhav are gonna share some tips and tricks for pushing AI coding tools to their absolute limits, while still shipping well-tested, bug-free code. This isn't vibe-coding, this is something completely different. |
| 2025-07-29<br/>**#16: Evaluating Prompts Across Models**<br/>[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OawyQOrlubM) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-07-29-eval-many-models-same-prompt) ‚Ä¢ PAST | AI That Works #16 will be a super-practical deep dive into real-world examples and techniques for evaluating a single prompt against multiple models. While this is a commonly heralded use case for Evals, e.g. "how do we know if the new model is better" / "how do we know if the new model breaks anything", there's not a ton of practical examples out there for real-world use cases. |
| 2025-07-22<br/>**#15: PDFs, Multimodality, Vision Models**<br/>[youtube](https://youtu.be/sCScFZB4Am8) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-07-22-multimodality) ‚Ä¢ PAST | Dive deep into practical PDF processing techniques for AI applications.

| 2025-07-15<br/>**#14 Implementing Decaying-Resolution Memory**<br/>[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEGSDlCtI8U) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-07-15-decaying-resolution-memory) ‚Ä¢ PAST | Last week on #13, we did a conceptual deep dive on context engineering and memory - this week, we're going to jump right into the weeds and implement a version of Decaying-Resolution Memory that you can pick up and apply to your AI Agents today. For this episode, you'll probably want to check out episode #13 in the session listing to get caught up on DRM and why its worth building from scratch. |
| 2025-07-08<br/>**#13: Building AI with Memory & Context**<br/>[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-doV02eh8XI) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-07-08-context-engineering) ‚Ä¢ PAST | How do we build agents that can remember past conversations and learn over time?

| 2025-07-01<br/>**#12: Boosting AI Output Quality**<br/>[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsElHU44xJ0) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-07-01-ai-content-pipeline-2) ‚Ä¢ PAST | This week's session was a bit meta! We explored "Boosting AI Output Quality" by building the very AI pipeline that generated this email from our Zoom recording. The real breakthrough: separating extraction from polishing for high-quality AI generation. |
| 2025-06-24<br/>**#11: Building an AI Content Pipeline**<br/>[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xece-W7Xf48) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-06-24-ai-content-pipeline) ‚Ä¢ PAST | Content creation involves a lot of manual work - uploading videos, sending emails, and other follow-up tasks that are easy to drop. We'll build an agent that integrates YouTube, email, GitHub and human-in-the-loop to fully automate the AI that Works content pipeline, handling all the repetitive work while maintaining quality. |
| 2025-06-17<br/>**#10: Entity Resolution: Extraction, Deduping, and Enriching**<br/>[youtube](https://youtu.be/niR896pQWOQ) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-06-17-entity-extraction) ‚Ä¢ PAST | Disambiguating many ways of naming the same thing (companies, skills, etc.) - from entity extraction to resolution to deduping. We'll explore breaking problems into extraction ‚Üí resolution ‚Üí enrichment stages, scaling with two-stage designs, and building async workflows with human-in-loop patterns for production entity resolution systems. |
| 2025-06-10<br/>**#9: Cracking the Prompting Interview**<br/>[youtube](https://youtu.be/PU2h0V-pANQ) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-06-10-cracking-the-prompting-interview) ‚Ä¢ PAST | ‚ÄãReady to level up your prompting skills? Join us for a deep dive into advanced prompting techniques that separate good prompt engineers from great ones.

Today we'll discuss techniques for how to make this possible. We'll dive deep into concepts from [our 4/22 session on 12-factor agents](./2025-04-22-twelve-factor-agents) and extend them to handle asynchronous operations where agents need to contact humans for help, feedback, or approvals across a variety of channels. |
| 2025-05-27<br/>**#7: 12-factor agents: selecting from thousands of MCP tools**<br/>[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5wRLKF4bt8) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-05-27-mcp-with-10000-tools) ‚Ä¢ PAST | MCP is only as great as your ability to pick the right tools. We'll dive into showing how to leverage MCP servers and accurately use the right ones when only a few have actually relevant tools. |
| 2025-05-20<br/>**#6: Policy to Prompt: Evaluating w/ the Enron Emails Dataset**<br/>[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkekVC67iVs) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-05-20-policies-to-prompts) ‚Ä¢ PAST | one of the most common problems in AI engineering is looking at a set of policies / rules and evaluating evidence to determine if the rules were followed. In this session we'll explore turning policies into prompts and pipelines to evaluate which emails in the massive [enron email dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/) violated SEC and Sarbanes-Oxley regulations.  |
| 2025-05-13<br/>**#5: evals evals evals**<br/>[youtube](https://youtu.be/-N6MajRfqYw) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-05-13-designing-evals) ‚Ä¢ [RSVP](https://lu.ma/j5y6bd3i) | stay tuned for our season 2 kickoff topic on minimalist and high-performance testing/evals for LLM applications |

| 2025-04-08<br/>**#2: reasoning models vs reasoning prompts**<br/>[youtube](https://youtu.be/D-pcKduKdYM) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-04-07-reasoning-models-vs-prompts) ‚Ä¢ PAST | models can reason but you can also reason within a prompt. which technique wins out when and why? we'll find out by adding reasoning to a chat bot that generates complex cypher/sql queries. |
| 2025-03-31<br/>**#1: large scale classification**<br/>[youtube](https://youtu.be/6B7MzraQMZk) ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-03-31-large-scale-classification) ‚Ä¢ PAST | ‚Äãllms are great at classification from 5, 10, maybe even 50 categories. but how do we deal with situations when we have over 1000? perhaps its an ever changing list of categories? |
