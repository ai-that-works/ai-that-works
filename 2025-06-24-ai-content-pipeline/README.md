## Key Takeaways

- Build infrastructure and workflow first before optimizing AI components for faster iteration
- Use real-time databases for UI updates instead of complex backend-to-frontend communication
- Test with real production data rather than synthetic examples for better quality
- Consider token-level formatting in prompts for structured output generation
- Implement type safety across the full stack to ensure data consistency
- Stream partial results while maintaining type safety for better UX

## Core Architecture

The content pipeline consists of several key components:

1. **Video Processing Layer**
   - Zoom API integration for recording retrieval
   - Video download and transcript generation
   - Storage management for raw content

2. **Content Generation Pipeline**
   - LLM-based summarization with structured outputs
   - Multi-step generation for complex content
   - Type-safe prompt templates and response parsing

3. **Distribution System**
   - Real-time database for state management
   - Email template generation and sending
   - Social media post scheduling
   - GitHub documentation updates

4. **Frontend Interface**
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Content preview and editing
   - Pipeline status monitoring

## Running the Code

```bash
# Backend setup
cd backend
uv sync
cp env.template .env
# Configure your environment variables

# Frontend setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Run the full pipeline
uv run python main.py
```
